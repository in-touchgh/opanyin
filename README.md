# weightapp

A Weight project.

## Getting Started

This project is a simple Flutter application built with Firebase Firestore as the database and Provider as a state management tool.

I have removed my google-services.json
so you will have to add your own if you want to test and also dont forget to allow Anonymous signin from your Firebase console :

- Architecture used is Model View Control
- If you find any part of the code problematic reach out to me babsosei@gmail.com.
- Peace.
